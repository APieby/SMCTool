**SMC Tool by David R:**
-
This tool is aimed at MacBook logic board technicians, and makes flashing a MacBook SMC quicker and easier. It not only saves time but money, as a specific donor board or SMC aren't necessary to have 'on hand'.

This tool is based on the work from  [logi.wiki](https://logi.wiki/index.php?title=SMC_flashing).\
Current Version: `1.0.3`

**Creating a USB disk:**
-
To begin, format a USB disk in ExFAT, FAT32 or HFS+ with a Master Boot Record (MBR) filesystem. Then....

- Option A: Manually copy the SMC_Tool.iso files to the formatted USB disk.\
`Hidden files must be shown, otherwise the volume icon and name may not transfer, thus the disk will show as 'EFI Boot'.`
- Option B: Write the raw SMC_Tool.img to disk with ddrescue, or similar.

**NOTE:** You may use a bootable USB creation tool, however, make sure to use the correct filesystem when formatting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Flashing an SMC:**
-
  1. Plug in the USB disk and power on the Mac whilst holding the `Option âŒ¥` key.
  2. Load into `SMC Tool` from the boot menu and let startup.nsh run.
  3. Type the boardnumber.nsh you want to flash, e.g: `820-00165.nsh`, the script will then flash the SMC.
  4. Type 'exit' to reboot, or power off machine to complete the process.

**If you flash the wrong firmware:**
-

In most cases all you'll need to do is reboot and flash again with the correct firmware. In some cases you **may** brick the system, however, after much testing I've never achieved a bricked board by flashing an incorrect firmware.

If a system is somehow rendered 'bricked' and will not get to the boot menu, you must replace the SMC.

I am not responsible if you do something wrong, if you're here I expect you know what you're doing. If your dad's uncle's friend suggested you use this as your MacBook fan is running too fast, I suggest you turn around and leave.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**You want to flash a different firmware:**
-
You can replace the update, base and app code image in the respective folder, say 820-00165 would be 'payloads\Mac-937CB26E2E02BB01'.

SMC payloads can be found in the firmwareupdate.pkg inside MacOS Install.ESD file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SMC hardware flashing:**
-
I'm actively investing time into this. So far it has proved not to be worth the time and effort, on top of this its getting harder to acquire blank TI LM4F and you must manually build payloads. This tool has slighlty toppled my will to continue putting effort in. However, I will keep going, no promises you'll hear any more about it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EFI Screen resolution:**
-
Type `mode` to display a list of supported screen modes, then type the highest mode available e.g. `mode 160 47`.

The script will automatically switch screen mode when it can.
